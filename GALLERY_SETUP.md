# Gallery Setup Instructions

## Photos Added to Gallery

Your portfolio now has a gallery section with 5 photos configured. Here's what I've done:

### ✅ Completed:

### 📸 Save Your Photos:

You need to save the 3 new photos you provided to the `public/images/` folder with these names:

1. **First photo (gray hoodie)** → Save as: `public/images/profile-1.jpg`
2. **Second photo (yellow striped shirt)** → Save as: `public/images/profile-2.jpg`
3. **Third photo (phone call)** → Save as: `public/images/profile-3.jpg`

### How to Save the Photos:

**Option 1: Manual Save**
1. Right-click on each image you sent
2. Save them to the `public/images/` folder
3. Rename them to match the names above

**Option 2: Using File Explorer**
